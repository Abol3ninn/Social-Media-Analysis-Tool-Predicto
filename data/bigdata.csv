I suffered from this myself after covid, sitting too much and not moving and my whole body hurt terribly. I recommend doing it before it's too late. If you just keep your back straight it won't help, you need your muscles to be more flexible."

MattTheSmithers,5/30/2024,"Been a prosecutor, been a defense attorney. Best thing Trump can do right now is shut up and show contrition. He is a nearly 80 year old man, likely suffering from dementia, with no record (before today üòÅ) who can likely avoid jail time if he just acts remotely normal.   Of course, this is a man who would‚Äôve coasted to re-election if he just acted like a normal president during COVID.   But I digress, instead he is going to use this press conference tomorrow to attack the prosecutors, the judge, the judge‚Äôs daughter, the jury, the witnesses, the Biden administration, Trump‚Äôs defense team, Mike Pence, the Taco Bell dog and really anyone else who pops into his demented old head.   And I don‚Äôt see how any judge doesn‚Äôt give him jail time after that.  Acceptance of responsibility is a huge deal when it comes to sentencing. And Trump, claiming to be a Christian, literally said he cannot thing of a single time he‚Äôs ever had to ask God for forgiveness or repent. He‚Äôs not going to accept responsibility. He‚Äôs not going to be contrite. He‚Äôs going to give Merchan no choice but to sentence him to jail.   And I am here for it."

CaptainNoBoat,5/30/2024,"**Convicted Felon Donald Trump**  We still have a few weeks to hear sentencing, and he will undoubtedly appeal, which could last well into 2025.  But that's not what is important today.  This IS history. Polling saying voters are partisan and unmoved doesn't make it any less significant.  For starters, it's not a ""hush money"" case, as the media has latched onto. It's an *election interference* case, and these are *felonies.*  He worked to illegally cover up stories that could have easily swung the 2016 election, which was won by a few thousand votes in a few states, and could have altered the course of American history. It encapsulates everything about Trump and is the beginning to his criminal history saga regarding the Presidency.  It is hopefully only the beginning of his criminal accountability, and a necessary step forward for democracy, the rule of law, and us as a country.  In summary, I'm opening up some fine bourbon tonight."

JGCZR,5/30/2024,"You talking about twice impeached, convicted felon, Donald J Trump?"

t65789,5/30/2024,Thinking of the Judge and the jurors. Thank you for your courage. Be safe.
crownpuff,5/30/2024,People that got convicted of 34 felonies should not be able to make lifetime judicial appointments.
BizarroObama,5/30/2024,"Crazy how Joe Biden successfully made Trump cheat on his wife, pay off a porn star, and commit fraud by covering it up.   Biden must be playing quantum 8D chess"

furtherdimensions,5/30/2024,"For those confused what the crime here was, I wrote this:  It's important to note here, that paying hush money is not illegal.  Paying hush money to bury a story is not illegal.  Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign is not illegal.  Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign and failing to report it to the Federal Election Commission, when the political campaign is for President of the United States *is* illegal.  Falsifying business records to hide the purpose of that money and evade the mandatory reporting to the FEC is a crime in the state of New York.    The issue is more subtle.  It's not that he paid hush money, it's that he doctored, and instructed others to doctor, business records in New York State to hide the (totally legal) use of funds in order to conceal the actual purpose of paying those funds, in order to evade the requirement that he report those funds to the FEC.    It would have been totally legal for Trump to have paid Daniels for her story, and paid her not to talk about it in the press.  And if he did those purely for personal reasons (like to save his family the embarrassment) he wouldn't have really needed to disclose them to anyone.  But if he paid those funds to increase his odds of winning the Presidential election he was legally mandated to report those funds to the FEC.  The jury found, based on the evidence presented, that those funds were paid to increase his chances to win the presidental election, not for any personal reasons.  They likewise found he failed to report the payment of those funds to the FEC, which is a crime, but it's a federal crime and not one the State of New York has jurisdiction over.    The jury further found that he doctored business records in order to conceal the fact that he committed a crime by failing to report the spending of campaign-related funds to the FEC.  Doctoring business records to conceal a crime is, in and of itself, a crime in the State of New York.  That's what he's convicted for.  Essentially the jury found:  * 1)  Trump paid, and directed others to pay certain funds used to induce people to to either purchase rights to stories in order to bury them, or to not disclose what they saw or knew (this is legal) * 2)  The purpose of those funds was to prevent unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye (also legal) * 3)  The purpose of attempting to prevent those unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye was to influence the 2016 Presidential Election (ALSO legal) * 4)  Trump failed to disclose the spending of those funds, spent with the intent of influencing the 2016 Presidential Election to the Federal Election Commission (illegal, but that's a federal crime, and one the state of New York has no jurisdiction to prosecute over) * 5)  Trump doctored, or directed others to doctor, business records of his New York based business to hide the true purpose of those funds (this is a misdemeanor in the state of new york) * 6)  The purpose behind doctoring those records was to conceal the fact that Trump committed a crime by failing to report the payment of those funds to the FEC (the failure to do so is a federal crime) * 7)  Doctoring business records in NY for the purposes of concealing a crime (any crime, state or federal) elevates the misdemeanor to a felony * 8)  Trump did this 34 times."

redpoemage,5/30/2024,"No matter what happens with sentencing, Donald Trump is now officially a convicted felon. Don't let people trick you into dooming and thinking that doesn't matter with at least some voters (and we've seen many times how few voters it can take to flip an election!).  This election is more winnable than ever. Go over to /r/VoteDEM if you want to find out ways to help.  Edit: And even if this has you super confident in the presidential election, the Senate is going to be a hard fight (Montana and Ohio will likely decide who controls the Senate), so let's work to make sure Biden will be able to confirm Supreme Court judges if there are any vacancies!"
Konukaame,5/30/2024,"Already seeing the posts screaming, ""If they can do this to a former president, they can do this to anybody.""   Yes? That's how laws are supposed to work?"

Smidge-of-the-Obtuse,5/30/2024,"I just want people to remember that it was a jury chosen by both the Prosecution and Defense, and any single juror could have voted no to any or all of the charges. Calling the verdict rigged not only invalidates our court system, but also the voices of 12 American citizens."

tehbantho,5/30/2024,"What a sad fucking day. The entire process disgusted me.   It's sad that a former President broke the law so brazenly.   It's sad that his supporters believe he is innocent.   It's sad that those same people somehow believe STATE criminal charges were brought by JOE BIDEN.   Trump can still win this election. We must vote, so overwhelmingly against his bullshit that it sends a clear message to the GOP."
ASmallTownDJ,5/30/2024,Looool his Wikipedia page has already been updated.
MattTheSmithers,5/30/2024,Fun fact that no one is discussing. Trump is currently the subject of three other criminal prosecutions and is now convicted of 34 felonies.  Any other person would have their bail revoked in the other cases.

Daviewayne,5/30/2024,"For all the maga folks about to come in here and scream ""WITCH HUNT!"" I have a question for you: let's say, a Democrat president is investigated and found to have committed a bunch of felonies. Should that President face accountability? And if so, by what method(s) do you propose that, we the people, should determine that the president committed said crimes and hold them accountable if not by the current method of a grand jury indictment and a jury conviction? And, In this scenario, how would you respond to Democrats claiming that this is just a political witch hunt?"
KingMario05,5/30/2024,"Thank. Fucking. ***GOD.***     Yeah, he probably won't serve jail time. Yes, it's the most minor of the charges on file.  **I don't care**.
